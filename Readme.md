# Points
## a partial renderer based on simple numerical concepts

The basic idea, is to only partially render an animation frame, in this case only 10% of all pixels are rendered. By using some basic number theory, I was able to create a renderer which can dynamically adapt the percentage of pixels per animation frame and make it look like some kind of noisy motion blur.
